I am a Robotics Engineer living in Los Angeles. Before coming to LA, I helped building up the robotics stack of the Berlin AI startup [micropsi industries](https://www.micropsi-industries.com/), which tries to solve hard problems in manufacturing with Machine Learning-equipped industrial robots. During my time in Berlin, I designed and implemented a reliable, safe and efficient framework to control robots from fuzzy real-time input which was (and still is) deployed at customer's warehouses.

During the pandemic I took on the opportunity to sink my teeth into a slightly different research project: Machine Learning-based recognition of planetary features at scale. I used the opportunity to experiment with new frameworks and learn a new language with _Rust_. More is to say about the actual project when the corresponding paper is finished but for now, I have published a big chunk of the code already with [__Celeste__](./projects/celeste).

I graduated with a Master's in __Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence__ from the __Technical University of Munich (TUM)__ and have a Bachelor in Computer Science from the __Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)__ . My fascination with robotics sky(crane)-rocketed when I was watching the landing of NASA's MSL Mars rover which influenced me most to pursue a degree in robotics. Because of my interest in space I was very lucky to have conclude my studies with my master's thesis at __NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory__.
