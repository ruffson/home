I am a Robotics Engineer living in Los Angeles working on Robot Motion Planning and Controls at [OffWorld](https://www.offworld.ai) in Pasadena. The company's mission is to remove humans from dangerous mining sites on earth and to bring autonomous robotic mining to space!

Before coming to LA, I helped build up the robotics stack at Berlin AI startup [micropsi industries](https://www.micropsi-industries.com/), which solves hard problems in manufacturing with Machine Learning-equipped industrial robots. During my time in Berlin, I designed and implemented a reliable, safe and efficient framework to control robots from fuzzy real-time input which was (and still is) deployed at customer's warehouses.

During the pandemic, I took the opportunity to sink my teeth into a slightly different research project: Machine Learning-based recognition of planetary features at scale. I used the opportunity to experiment with new frameworks and learn a new language with _Rust_. A paper on this project is in the works, and a big chunk of the code is already available as [__Celeste__](./projects/celeste).

I graduated with a Master's in __Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence__ from the __Technical University of Munich (TUM)__ and have a Bachelor in Computer Science from the __Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)__. My fascination with robotics sky(crane)-rocketed when I watched the landing of NASA's MSL Mars rover, which served as my inspiration to pursue a degree in robotics. Because of my interest in space, I concluded my studies with my master's thesis at __NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory__.
